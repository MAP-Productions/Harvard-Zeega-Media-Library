The core of this user experience is to allow a large collection of heterogeneous multimedia materials (e.g. images, audio, videos) to be explored through a single, integrated discovery interface that is tightly coupled with curation tools for building collections. These curated materials are then available for further use in an authoring environment for multimedia presentations, and these presentations then also become part of the overall library collection, available through the same core discovery and curation interface.
